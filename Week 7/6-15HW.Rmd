# **R Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr**

## Installation

The package `tidyverse` contains a group of packages that are useful for
when we want to focus on Data Analytics.

The R library `ggplot2` is a super useful tool we can use to create
visualizations and explore our data.

The R library `dplyr` is a super useful too we can use to explore and
manipulate our data.

```{r}
# Install our packages
install.packages('tidyverse')

# Load our packages
library(tidyverse)

```

More things we can do to get more information on R and what we're doing:

```{r}
# To better understand how we can work with a package or information on a built-in dataset, we can use the help, or ? to do so

#help(tidyverse)
?tidyverse
```

We'll need a few more packages for our exploration usage, too. We can
install them all at once by using the `c()` function, which creates a
list. We'll open these packages with the `library()` function later.

```{r}
install.packages(c('nycflights13', 'gapminder', 'Lahman'))

library(nycflights13)

nycflights13::flights
```

## Exploration

### Using `dplyr` for Data Exploration

`dplyr` is a powerful package for data manipulation and exploration. It
provides a set of functions that can be used to filter, group, and
summarize data. In this section, we will explore some of the most
commonly used functions in `dplyr`.

A few things about data and data types in R! Like Python, we have
specified types of data we'll use in our tables.

-   int is integer

-   dbl is doubles

-   chr is for character or characters

-   dttm is date-time

-   lgl is logical - similar to Booleans in Python or other programming
    languages; either TRUE or FALSE

-   fctr is factors (We won't use these much yet)

-   date - self explanatory.

### There are five main processes we'll use with dplyr to manipulate our data:

-   `filter()` our data by choosing data by value

-   `arrange()` data by reordering rows

-   `select()` specific data items

-   `mutate()` existing data into new data

-   `summarize()` values into a single summary

Like SQL, we'll use aggregation to break these functions down into
groups; we'll do so by using a `group_by()` function as well.

dplyr functions follow a common syntax: \`function_name(\<data frame\>,
\<\*args\>)\<resulting data frame\>. Many data frames in R are called
'tibbles'. Don't worry too much about what this means for now - just
imagine them like tables in SQL for right now. An example of the dplyr
syntax:

```{r}
# Filters the information where it is equal to the values given by column:
#filter(flights, month == 3, day == 31)

View(flights)
```

In the above example, I had two arguments - month == 3, and day == 31.
This filtered down the results to only display flights that occurred on
March 31, which is the day I wrote this (except the `nycflights13` data
is from 2013 - RStudio was only two years old!)

Remember, too, that just like ggplot2 - we can still ask questions in
our console, like `?flights` to get more information.

Much like python, we can compare values using comparison operators -
`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`. We also get to use & and \| for
comparisons of multiple booleans.

```{r}
carrier_df <- filter(flights, carrier=='AA' | carrier == 'DL' | carrier == 'UA')
carrier_df
```

```{r}
dep_time_df <- filter(flights, dep_time <= 1000 & sched_arr_time >= 1000 & arr_delay != 0)

dep_time_df
```

### Arranging Rows

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day, desc(sched_dep_time))

View(arrange(flights, year, month, day, desc(sched_dep_time)))
```

## Selecting Columns

```{r}
# Call to the dataframe to get a single column:
flights$dep_time
```

```{r}
# What if I want more than a single column?
# Indexing is always an option, but dplyr has a built-in method instead
# This can be used to give back data instead:
select(flights, year, month, day)
View(select(flights, year, month, day))
```

We can also use `-` to exclude columns from the selection:

```{r}
View(select(flights, -carrier, -dep_time))
```

`dplyr` has built in helper functions that can return data to us as well
when used in conjunction with our select statement!

Some examples of these are:

-   starts_with()

-   ends_with()

-   contains()

-   matches() - inside of this, you'll insert a string of Regex

-   num_range("n", 5:7) will match n5, n6, and n7

-   everything() will include all the rest of the columns. So you can
    put it at the end of a select statement as a parameter, and you'll
    be able to move selected columns to the left side, and then include
    the rest of the data.

```{r}
# Select all columns from flights:
View(select(flights, everything()))

# Select all columns from flights that starts with the letter "c"
View(select(flights, starts_with("c")))

# Select all columns from flights that end with the letter "e"
View(select(flights, ends_with('e')))

# Select all columns that contain the letter "g"
View(select(flights, contains('g')))

# Select all columns that match the regex expression "fl|c"
View(select(flights, matches('fl|c')))
```

Select can also be used to get columns by index. To do so, we use the
`:` operator we learned about yesterday to specify a range of column
indicies:

```{r}
select(flights, 1:3)
```

### Mutating Data

Besides being a terrifying name, mutating data is an important part of
exploring out data. This function allows us to combine observations from
other columns to create a new column of observations. For example:

```{r}
flight_data <- select(flights,
                      year:day,
                      ends_with('delay'),
                      distance,
                      air_time
                      )
View(flight_data)

# Apply a mutation:
flight_data_mut <- mutate(flight_data,
                          gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
                          speed = distance / air_time * 60)

View(flight_data_mut)
```

You can now see the `gain` and `speed` columns have been created;
`mutate()` always places those new columns at the end of the data set,
so if you'd want to move them to the front, you'd use `select()`.

Keep in mind as you do mutations that whatever process you end up using
has to be something that iterates on data sets, and that produces
something iterable as well.

### Transmute Data

Transmutation is when we want to create these new variables in our
dataframe, but only want to return those variables back to us!

```{r}
flight_data <- select(flights,
                      year:day,
                      ends_with('delay'),
                      distance,
                      air_time
                      )
View(flight_data)

# Apply a transmutation:
flight_data_mut <- transmute(flight_data,
                          gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
                          speed = distance / air_time * 60)

View(flight_data_mut)
```

### Summarizing Data

```{r}
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

First off, this is kind of a weird table. It only has one piece of data
in it! Not especially useful. By the way, the `na.rm = True` line asks
the function to remove any missing values in the data. If we didn't have
it when we use `group_by()`, we'd have a lot of observations reading
`NA`, which isn't very helpful. In our current data set, the delay times
for cancelled flights are populating the database with `NA` values.

Summarizing data is a lot easier if we use `group_by()` with it. This is
very similar to how we use aggregate functions in SQL.

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)

summarize(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## In-Class Exercise 1:

Using the built in dataset, `mtcars`;

-   Select all columns that start with `'m'`

-   Select all columns that end with `'g'`

-   Select all columns that matches mp or c

-   Mutate a new column using the `disp` and `cyl` columns.

-   Summarize your data!

```{r}

```

### Using Pipe to string together functions

These functions become more and more useful when we can combine them
together - often our exploration will be multi-step. Fortunately,
there's a way we can combine functions together - pipe.

Imagine we want to look at the relationship between distance and average
delay for each location. We'll group flights by destination, figure out
distance, average delay, and number of flights, and then filter out
noise and the airport in Honolulu, which is so far away from other
airports that it will make it hard to see the data we want to focus on.

```{r}
# Code I would have to use before a pipe:
by_destination <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarize(by_destination,
                   count = n(), # n() give us the current group size
                   dist = mean(distance, na.rm=TRUE),
                   delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE))

delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != 'HNL')
View(delay)
```

A more efficient way of doing the same thing, where we don't need to
write variables for each step over and over, uses pipe:

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm=TRUE),
    delay = mean(distance, na.rm=TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count>20, dest != "HNL")
View(delays)
```

This way, we can simply thread queries together without having to write
new variables every time. It's inferred that each function is working on
the same data frame, so we don't need to write it in as the first
parameter of each function here. It's pretty normal to add a count
function into our code as well, so that we know how large our data sets
are - if we've queried our data down into a very small number of values,
it can be easy to mistakenly draw conclusions based on a very small
amount of data.

Please note: The only part of the tidyverse that won't work with pipe is
ggplot2. You can pipe into it, but you can't pipe afterwards.

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(mean=mean(dep_delay))

View(not_cancelled)
```

## In-Class Exercise 2:

Using the `flights` dataset, create your own column, then create a
filter that removes values for carrier where it is equal to 'UA'. Then
group the dataset by the sched_arr_time, summarize the data and View
your data.

```{r}

```

## Visualizations with ggplot2

Now we can look at the plotted data of delay times, and try to learn
something about delay times.

```{r}
# Create a delay subset of our data. Group by the tail number and summarize using the mean of the arr_delay column:

delay <- not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(
    delay = mean(arr_delay)
  )

ggplot(data=delays, mapping=aes(x=delay)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth=10)
```

This chart makes it look like there are planes with an average delay of
5 hours, which is bizarre. Maybe we're not looking at a large enough
data set! For example - maybe we're working with a small data set, like
if we were only looking at a small number of total flights. Imagine if
this data set were only 100 flights, and one plane had a 10 hour delay,
and no delay on it's second flight. That plane would now appear to have
5 hours of delay on average! Obviously, this is a problem, and we need
to be sure that we don't have too small of a data set.

```{r}
delay <- not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(
    delay = mean(arr_delay),
    n=n()
  )

ggplot(data=delay, mapping = aes(x=n, y=delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) # Alpha changes the opacity 
```

Now we have a better idea. Let's change the plot parameters so we can
get a better look at the bulk of our data - we have some outliers for
flights that are greatly delayed here, and we can see that the flights
with heavy delays have very few flights to their name. It's possible
these planes had other issues causing their delays, and they didn't do
any other flights.

```{r}
delay %>%
  filter(n>25) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=n, y=delay)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```

Looks like the majority of flights leave on time most of the time. This
is a much better data set to look at to find information about the bulk
of flight delays.

Built in to our tidyverse are several data sets that we can play around
with. In the below code block, we create a variable `myplot` and save
the `mpg` database to it.

```{r}
myplot <- mpg

View(myplot)
```

**Something you should be aware of and have open (perhaps on a second
monitor, or you can print them out) is the ggplot2 cheat sheet!**

### QPlot

`Qplot`, or quick-plot, uses inference to build a plot in the quickest,
easiest fashion with little to no code. For example, we can look at the
diamonds dataset and quickly plot the carat and price columns from it

```{r}
#?diamonds

qplot(carat, price, data=diamonds)
```

We can see that there is some form of linear relationship here, but with
the way the values currently fall on the graph, we may want to normalize
these values first. Here's how we can do that using the `log()`
function:

```{r}
qplot(log(carat), log(price), data = diamonds)
```

Now, we can clearly see the linear relationship between carat and price!

In another example, we can look at the mtcars dataset and quickly plot
the carb and cyl columns from it

```{r}
qplot(carb, cyl, data=mtcars)
```

#### Arguments

Arguments in ggplot2 can be a combination of already existing variables
as well!

```{r}
qplot(carat, x*y*z, data=diamonds)
```

Some of the basic arguments of `qplot()` are:

-   **Colour:** Using `colour`, we can point towards a column of the
    dataframe object to use as a color.

-   **Size:** Using `size`, we can adjust the size of each data point
    available.

-   **Shape:** `Shape` transforms the appearance of the dots on the
    scatterplot.

-   **Alpha:** `Alpha` refers to the opacity of your dots on the
    scatterplot.

```{r}
qplot(carat,
      price,
      data=diamonds,
      colour = color,
      size = 1,
      alpha = 1/100)
```

One thing to note is that the color and shape work well with discrete
data, while size works well with continuous!

```{r}
# Creates the histogram
qplot(price, data=diamonds, binwidth=500) + 
  # Creates the titles and axis labels
  labs(x='Price', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Distribution of Diamond Prices')+
  # Adjusts the title positioning
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

## In-Class Exercise 3:

Using `qplot()`, create a graphic from the diamonds dataset. Write out
an explanation on how that graphic represents some relationship between
independent and dependent variables.

```{r}

```

## Visualizations Cont.

### `ggplot()`

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, colour = class))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, colour = displ))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, colour = displ < 5))
```

```{r}

```

#### Facets

##### What is faceting?

Faceting is a data visualization technique used to display subsets of a
dataset in separate panels or plots. Each panel corresponds to a unique
value or combination of values of a variable, allowing you to examine
patterns and trends across different subgroups of your data.

In ggplot2, faceting is achieved using the `facet_wrap()` or
`facet_grid()` functions. `facet_wrap()` arranges panels in a grid based
on a single variable, while `facet_grid()` arranges panels based on two
variables.

To use faceting, you first need to identify the variable or variables
that you want to use to split your data into subsets. Then, you add the
appropriate facet function to your `ggplot` code and specify the
variable(s) to use for faceting.

```{r}
ggplot(data = myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, shape = drv, colour =rgb(0.7,1.0,.3)))+
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow = 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, shape = drv, colour = rgb(0.7,1.0,.3)))+
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow=3)+
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1,2,3)) + 
  xlab("Engine Displacement (L)")+
  ylab("Highway Miles Per Gallon (MPG)")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=10, color = 'blue'),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=10, color = 'red'),
        legend.position = 'bottom')
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
```

The \~ symbol in drv \~ . is used to specify the formula for the grid of
plots. In this case, it specifies that we want to split the data into
different subsets based on the levels of the drv variable, and create a
grid of plots using all other variables in the data.

Possible variations: facet_grid(. \~ drv) would create a grid of plots
where each plot shows the relationship between drv and all other
variables in the data, split by the levels of each variable.
facet_grid(drv \~ cyl) would create a grid of plots where each plot
shows the relationship between mpg, hp, and all other variables in the
data, split by the levels of drv and cyl. facet_wrap(drv \~ .) is a
similar function that creates a grid of plots, but instead of arranging
them in a grid, it wraps them into a single row or column.

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .) +
  ggtitle("Highway MPG vs Engine Displacement") + 
  xlab("Engine Displacement (L)")+
  ylab("Highway MPG")+
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom',
        legend.text = element_text(size=10))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy), position = 'jitter')
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=myplot) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, linetype = drv))+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy, colour = drv))
```

```{r}
ggplot(myplot, aes(displ, hwy, linetype = drv)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds)+
  geom_bar(aes(cut))
```

Whoa, where'd count come from? **Count is not a variable or attribute of
the variable diamonds!** Count comes automatically with a lot of graphs
as an attribute. You can verify what I'm saying with `?diamonds` in the
console.

Any attribute of a data set that is algorithmically calculated is called
a *stat*, which is short for a statistical transformation. Many of the
**geom** functions have stats built in, and many stats display geoms.
For example, the above code block used a geom, but this one uses a stat,
and results in an identical chart:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds)+
  stat_count(aes(cut))
```

Let's add color here!

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(cut, color = cut))
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(cut, fill =cut))
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(cut, fill =clarity), position = 'fill')
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, position = 'identity')
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(cut, colour = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(fill = NA, position = 'identity')
```

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(cut, fill = clarity), position = 'dodge')
```

#### Pie Chart

What if I wanted to add an additional variable to my graph as well as
change the graphic into a pie chart?

```{r}
pie = ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(cut, fill = clarity),
           position = 'fill') +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)

pie + coord_polar()
```

```{r}
pie = ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(cut, fill = clarity),
           position = 'dodge') +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)

pie + coord_polar()
```

#### In-Class Discussion

Is this a good graphic? Why? What information is being returned to us
and how is it useful?

```{r}
# Overall, the graphics above for our pie charts do not offer any additional or better information than that of our side-by-side bar chart or a histogram.
# We would need to spend additional time explanining each aspect of our visualization to whomever was viewing it BEFORE it could even be remotely useful.
# This makes it not a good graphic!
```

#### Box-Plots

to generate a box-plot, we can use the `geom_boxplot()` function in
conjunction with our `ggplot()` library

```{r}
ggplot(myplot, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### Customizing a box-plot

```{r}
ggplot(myplot, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = '#336699', color = '#336699', alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0, color = '#FFA550', alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = 'Highway MPG by Car Class', x = 'Car Class', y = 'Highway MPG') +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip()
```

## In-Class Exercise 4:

Using ggplot2, create a custom graphic using the `Lahman` built-in
dataset we loaded earlier this lecture. Your graphic should be proceeded
with data exploration as well as a hypothesis about the data before
creating the graphic. Your graphic should include colors, a title for
all axes and for the graphic itself.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Vizulations Cont.

#### Map Data

```{r}
nz <- map_data("nz")

ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = 'white', color = 'black')
```

```{r}
ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = 'white', colour = 'black') +
  coord_quickmap()
```

#### Customize a map

```{r}
ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = 'white', colour = 'black') +
  coord_quickmap() + 
  ggtitle("Map of New Zealand") +
  labs(x = 'Longitude', y = 'Latitude') +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12))
```

## Functions and Conditionals

### Functions

#### When should we use functions?

When I have to type a line of code multiple times to accomplish the same
thing.

### Why should I use a Function?

Reproducibility/Automation

Once I build a function, I can use across my programs.

```{r}
# In Python, we are used to seeing this syntax:
# def function(optional params):
  # Do stuff
  # Return stuff


# Syntax in R
our_function <- function(optional_parameters){
  # Do stuff
}
our_function
```

An example:

```{r}
# Create a function to convert C to F
# Formula for conversion is C* (9/5) + 32
c_to_f <- function(v){
  temp_fahr <- v * (9/5) + 32
  
  return(temp_fahr)
}

# Call to the function to see if it works!
c_to_f(0)
```

This is all cool.. but it didn't do anything. We need to call the
function!

```{r}
# Create a vector:
test_temp <- c(16.550540, 26.942005, 32.591088, 8.580116, 28.03873, 28.542391, 21.976820, 21.173577, 21.048836, 18.769735)

# Then we will call to the function:
c_to_f(test_temp)
```

Notice that in the background here, we are looping over each item in the
array, but we never write a for loop! Keep this in mind, since when you
pass in a large data set, the changes made by functions aren't quite
immediate - the computer does have to go over each item in your data
set, and change them one at a time.

A shortcut of sorts is to use the `apply()` function, which operates
very similarly to Python's `map()`. Note that `apply` syntax goes as
follows: `apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)` where X is the data set to use, MARGIN
is specification for rows or columns, and FUN is the function to apply.

```{r}
# Create testing matrix
test_mat <- matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2), nrow=2)
test_mat
class(test_mat)

# Apply function:
# First, we will give our X, or the testing matrix,
# Then, we will tell it where to apply the function to; 1 being rows, 2 being columns
# Then we will tell it what function to apply. We will use the built-in sum function from R
apply(test_mat, 2, sum)
```

It is common to use `mean`, `median`, `sum`, `min`, or `max` with
`apply`, but we can also use our user-defined functions as well. Note
that apply() only works with matrices.

```{r}
test_temp_mat <- matrix(test_temp, nrow=2)
test_temp_mat

apply(test_temp_mat, 1, c_to_f)
```

#### More Functions!

Now, let's create a function to check if a number is even or odd!

```{r}
check_num <- function(x){
  if (x %% 2 == 0){
    print('Even')
  } else {
    print('Odd')
  }
}

# Test our function!
check_num(4)
check_num(7)
```

Next, let's calculate a factorial:

```{r}
# 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
calc_factorial <- function(x){
  if (x < 0){
    print('Factorial is not defined for negative numbers!')
  } else if (x == 0){
    print("Factorial of 0 is 1")
  } else{
    result <- 1
    for (i in 1:x){
      result <- result * i
    }
    print(paste("Factorial of", x, 'is', result, '.'))
  }
}

calc_factorial(5)
calc_factorial(-3)
calc_factorial(0)
```

What if we wanted to use a function on a vector?:

```{r}
# Calculate the mean of a vector:
# We will aggregate the vector into a single number
calc_mean <- function(x){
  # IS it empty?
  if (length(x) == 0) {
    print("Cannot calculate the mean of an empty vector!")
  } else {
    sum <- 0
    for (i in 1:length(x)) {
      sum <-  sum + x[i]
    }
    print(paste0('Mean of the vector is: ', sum/length(x), '.'))
  }
}

# Test it out!
calc_mean(c(2,4,6))
calc_mean(c())
```

```{r}
# Maximum of a vector instead of the mean:
calc_max <- function(x){
  if (length(x) == 0) {
    print('Cannot calculate the max of an empty vector')
  } else {
    max <- x[1]
    for (i in 2:length(x)) {
      if (x[i] > max) {
        max <- x[i]
      }
    }
    print(paste0("Maximum value of the vector is: ", max,'.'))
  }
}

calc_max(c(2,4,6))
calc_max(c())
```

## In Class Exercise 5:

Create a function that checks if a number is positive or negative. Your
function should account for zero.

Test it using a positive and negative number as well as 0.

```{r}

```

## Conditionals

The basic syntax for an if statement goes like this:

```{r}
# In R, we follow more of a JS notation:
# What is a logical statement?
# Logical statements mean anything that equates out to a boolean value
if (logical_statement) {
  do something
} else if (logical_statement_2){
  do this thing
} else {
  do something here instead
}
```

The logical statements should boil down to a boolean; for example:

```{r}
a <- 10

if (a<=5){
  print(a)
} else {
  print("The input value is greater than 5")
}
```

We can also add else if statements in the middle if we need more
options.

```{r}
b <- 15

if (b <= 5){
  print('small number')
} else if (b > 5 & b <= 10) {
  print('medium number')
} else{
  print('big number')
}
```

We can also nest conditionals just like we do in Python.

```{r}
c <- 5

if (c/2 != 0){
  if(c==5){
    if (c <10){
      print('c is 5')
    }
  }
}
```

Nested ifelse statement: This is a powerful way to evaluate multiple
conditions within a single ifelse statement. The syntax for nested
ifelse statements is ifelse(condition1, value1, ifelse(condition2,
value2, ifelse(condition3, value3, value4))). Here is an example:

```{r}
x <- 10

y <-  ifelse(x < 5, 'low', ifelse(x<10, 'medium', 'high'))
y
```

Switch statement: The switch statement is similar to a series of ifelse
statements but can be more efficient and easier to read. The syntax is
switch(expression, value1, value2, ..., valueN).

```{r}
z <- 2

switch(z, 'one', 'two', 'three')
```

Case_when statement: The case_when statement is a versatile way to
evaluate multiple conditions and assign values. The syntax is
case_when(condition1 \~ value1, condition2 \~ value2, ..., TRUE \~
valueN).

One thing to note here, is that case_when is associated with your
`dplyr` library. In order to use this, we should have either that or the
`tidyverse` library pre-loaded.

```{r}
x <- 10

case_when(x<5 ~ 'low', x <10 ~ 'medium', TRUE ~ "high")
```

Short-circuit evaluation: Short-circuit evaluation is a way to evaluate
conditional statements more efficiently by only checking the second
condition if the first condition is true. The syntax is condition1 &&
condition2.

```{r}
y <-  if(x<5 || x>20){
  print('out of range')
} else{
  print('in range')
}
y
```

## In Class Exercise 6:

Create two vectors of numbers. Using a conditional statement, change the
value for the vectors into a character type:

```{r}

```

Now, let's look at another core part of R programming - Loops!

### Loops

```{r}
for (val in x){
  do something
}
```

```{r}
for (value in 1:5){
  print(paste(value, 'is greater than', value-1))
}

```

We can also do nifty stuff with our vectors, such as apply changes to
specific indices of our data.

```{r}
vec <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)

# Change the first, third, and sixth elements in my vector to the value of 6:
for(i in c(1,3,6)){
  vec[i] <- 6
}
vec
```

We can loop over more than just lists:

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1, nrow=5, ncol=5)

for (row in 1:3){
  for (col in 3:5){
    mat[row, col] <- 15
  }
}
mat
```

```{r}
mat <-  matrix(1:12, ncol = 4)
means <- numeric(nrow(mat))

for (i in 1:nrow(mat)){
  means[i] <- mean(mat[i,])
}
print(means)
```

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:12, ncol = 4)
sums <- numeric(ncol(mat))

for (i in 1:ncol(mat)){
  sums[i] <- sum(mat[,i])
}

sums
```

Like Python, we have while loops in R:

```{r}
while (condition) {
  do something
}
```

## In Class Exercise 7:

Write a while loop that calculates the sum of the numbers 1-10:

```{r}

```

## Tibbles

### What is a Tibble?

A tibble is a dataframe that has a "modern" take. They are designed to
make working with data easier and more intuitive. It is part of our
`tidyverse` package!!!!

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Create a tibble with different data types

num <- c(1,2,3)

char <- c("John", 'Jane', 'Jimmy')

fact <- factor(c('male', 'female', 'male'))

logi <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Bring them all together
my_tbl <- tibble(num, char, fact, logi)

my_tbl
View(my_tbl)
```

#### Data Frames VS Tibbles

Some main differences between the two:

-   Tibbles print only the first few rows and all columns that fit on
    the screen, making it easier to view large data sets without
    overwhelming the console.

-   Tibbles also show their data type for each column (for example:
    `<chr>` for character, `<dbl>` for doubles)

-   Tibbles have a stricter subsetting mechanism than data frames. When
    you extract a single column from a tibble, it returns a tibble
    instead of a vector. When you extract a single row, it returns a
    tibble with one row instead of a data frame with one row. This
    behavior helps avoid common programming errors.

-   Tibbles preserve the case of variable names, while data frames do
    not. Tibbles also allow column names to be specified with backticks,
    which is useful when using reserved words or names with spaces or
    special characters.

-   Tibbles are more consistent than data frames in their treatment of
    data types. They do not coerce character vectors to factors, and
    they do not silently drop dimensions when subsetting.

-   Tibbles treat missing values more consistently than data frames.
    Missing values are always displayed as "NA", regardless of the data
    type. This avoids the confusion that can arise when missing values
    are represented differently for different data types (e.g., "NA",
    "NaN", ".")

```{r}
# How we can create a dataframe object
my_df <- data.frame(num, char, fact, logi)
my_df
```

We can see that tibbles offer us much more information! They are also
easier to manipulate, work well with tidyr and dplyr.

What if we wanted to convert a Data Frame object into a Tibbles object?
We have a method for that!

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x=1:26, y= letters[1:26], z= c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE))

tb <- as_tibble(df)
tb
```

If we need to make a tibble display more columns than it thinks it
should, we can override it with `print()`:

```{r}
print(tb)
```

The best way to see more of the data than a tibble default displays is
to use View(). Nice!

```{r}
View(tb)
```

#### Subsetting

```{r}
tb$x
tb[1]
```

At this point, it should be pointed out that the transformation
functions from `dplyr` are extremely valuable in context of subsets. In
most programming, there are multiple ways of finding the same answer;
this applies here as well.

You can also turn a tibble back into a data frame with
`as.data.frame()`. This only really comes into play if you're
interacting with older code.

## Reading Data

```{r}
View(read_csv("C:/Users/RedneckRandy/Downloads/femaleMiceWeights (1).csv"))
```

## Tibble Functions

Tibble and dplyr work wonders together! We can manipulate Tibbles using
dplyr functions, which provide us a streamlined way to filter, select,
group, summarize, and mutate data! \### `filter()`

```{r}
filter(my_tbl, num > 1)
```

### `select()`

```{r}
select(my_tbl, num, char)
```

### `group_by()`, `summarize()`

```{r}
group_by(my_tbl, fact) %>% summarize(avg_num = mean(num))

```

### `mutate()`

```{r}
mutate(my_tbl, num_squared = num ^2)
```

## N/A Values

Tibbles handle missing data in a similar way to data frames. By default,
missing values are represented by NA (not available) in tibbles.
However, there are several functions available in R to handle missing
values in tibbles.

It's worth noting that tibbles also have a special column type for
missing values called missing. This can be useful in cases where NA is a
valid value in a column, but we want to be able to distinguish between
missing values and non-missing values.

One of the most common functions used to handle missing values in
tibbles is na_if(), which can be used to replace specified values with
NA.

```{r}
tb <- tibble(x = c(1,2,'missing', 4,5, 'missing'))

tb <- tb %>%
  mutate(x = na_if(x, 'missing'))

tb
```

Now that we replaced all our "missing" values with a NA, let's explore
how tibbles handles replacing these values!

Tibbles uses the function `replace_na()`, which we can use to replace
all the `NA` values with a specified value.

```{r}
tb <- tb %>%
  replace_na(list(x='0'))
tb
```

## Importing/Exporting Data

Tibbles can be imported and exported using a variety of file formats!
Some examples of this are CSV, Excel, and even SQL databases!

```{r}
# Import data as a tibble:
my_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/RedneckRandy/Downloads/femaleMiceWeights (1).csv") %>% as_tibble()
my_data

# Export data as a CSV file:
write_csv(my_data, 'my_data.csv')
```

### Homework

1.  Do 5 CodeWars problems in R. Share your solutions here:

    ```{r}
    # Problem 1 I solved in R:
    #Convert number to reversed array of digits
    #
    digitize <- function(n) {
  digits <- as.numeric(strsplit(as.character(n), "")[[1]])#convert number to character and split into individual digits
  reversed_digits <- rev(digits)#reverse the order of the digits
  return(reversed_digits)#return the reversed array of digits
}

  # Problem 2 I solved in R:
    #Grasshopper - Summation
    #
    summation <- function(n) {
  sum <- 0  #sum to 0
  for (i in 1:n) {
    sum <- sum + i#accumulate the sum by adding each number from 1 to num
  }
  return(sum)#return the summation
}
    
      # Problem 3 I solved in R:
    #Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List
    #
    minimum <- function(vec){
   min_num <- min(vec)#find the minimum number using the min() function
  return(min_num)#return the minimum number
 } 

maximum <- function(vec){
  max_num <- max(vec)#find the maximum number using the max() function
  return(max_num)#return the maximum number
 } 

    
      # Problem 4 I solved in R:
    #Beginner - Reduce but Grow
    #
grow <- function(arr) {
  result <- 1#the result to 1
  for (num in arr) {
    result <- result * num #multiply each number in the array with the result
  }
  return(result)#return the multiplied result
}
    
      # Problem 5 I solved in R:
    #Simple multiplication
    #
simple_multiplication <- function(number) {
  if (number %% 2 == 0) {
    result <- number * 8#multiply by eight if the number is even
  } else {
    result <- number * 9#multiply by nine if the number is odd
  }
  return(result)#return the multiplied result
}
    ```

2.  Create a function that checks an input of type `int` and returns
    fizz if the number is a multiple of 3, buzz if the number is a
    multiple of 5, and fizzbuzz if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5.

    ```{r}
fizzbuzz <- function(num) {
  if (num %% 3 == 0 && num %% 5 == 0) {    #check if num is divisible by both 3 and 5
    return("fizzbuzz")            
  } else if (num %% 3 == 0) {              #check if num is divisible by 3
    return("fizz")  
  } else if (num %% 5 == 0) {              #check if num is divisible by 5
    return("buzz")                        
  }
}
print(fizzBuzz(3))
print(fizzBuzz(10))
print(fizzBuzz(15))

    ```

3.  **Mario Challenge:** In the classic Super Mario games, Mario ends
    each level by ascending a flight of stairs and leaping off the top
    to arrive at the castle at the end. (See
    [here](https://youtu.be/-avspZlbOWU?t=55) for details). We can
    imagine that each of the bricks of the stairs is a character X.
    Create a function that prints out a set of stairs. For example:

    If the function is called marioStairs() and we pass in the value 4,
    we would expect to see stairs with a length of 4 and a height of 4:

    X

    XX

    XXX

    XXXX

    ```{r}
    # You may feel more comfortable figuring this out in Python first, then translating into R later.
    
marioStairs <- function(length) {
  for (i in 1:length) {    #loop to iterate over each row 
    for (j in 1:i) {       #loop to iterate over each column 
      cat("X ")            #print "X " without appending a new line character
    }
    cat("\n")              # Move to the next line after each row
  }
}
marioStairs(4)

    
    ```

4.  Find a built-in dataset you would like to explore. Explore the
    dataset and use the cheat sheet you built in Week 1 to label
    continuous and discrete data. Analyze the dataset using dplyr,
    create graphs, mutate two columns, and formulate a hypothesis about
    your data.

#### **Data Types:**

-   Column 1: Data Type

-   Column 2: Data Type

```{r}
data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
continuous_vars <- c("mpg", "disp", "hp", "drat", "wt", "qsec")
discrete_vars <- c("cyl", "vs", "am", "gear", "carb")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg), median_mpg = median(mpg))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Weight", y = "Miles per Gallon") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of MPG vs. Weight")
```

```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(new_column1 = disp / cyl, new_column2 = hp * am)

#Formulate a hypothesis
#Hypothesis: There is a negative relationship between Weight (wt) and Miles per Gallon (mpg). We see as weight of the vehicle increases, the miles per gallon decreases.

```
